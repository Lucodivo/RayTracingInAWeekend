Following along to [Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf) but it's a weekday ðŸ˜ˆ

At the time of going through this book, I have had experience with rasterization, some ray tracing and some ray marching. 
I was able to produce the ray tracer as described, however, I don't believe there were adequate explanations of the code. 
The code has bad variable names ("uv" for a unit vector, "dt" for a dot product, and other odd choices) and almost no comments, 
so the readability of the code itself isn't really there either. The positive side is that the book sets you up with working 
code that can be backwards engineered with additional research to get a better understanding. That was fruitful but I found a lot 
of my learning was done outside of the book, trying to figure out why it wanted me to write some line of code. 

I am still very grateful to Peter Shirley for writing this book and distributing it for free. There are a few concepts I will
not forget after having read this book.

Final result: <br>
